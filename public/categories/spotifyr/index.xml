      <description>So I came across the awesome Spotifyr spotifyr package earlier this year. A package that lets you easily explore the extensive Spotify API within R. And when I read this article about generative art on Quantixed made in R it got me thinking about combining these two.
The end result is a continuously updating &amp;lsquo;art piece&amp;rsquo; made in Shiny. Generated by the computer with input from the music I play on Spotify.</description>
