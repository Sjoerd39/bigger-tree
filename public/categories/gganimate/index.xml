      <description>The 7-hills running race (7-heuvelenloop) is a yearly running race in and around Nijmegen. The main event is a race of 15 kilometers long. I ran it myself a couple of times, but not in last year. On to animating the race. Using the following packages:
library(tidyverse) library(zoo) library(readxl) library(lubridate) library(magrittr) library(gganimate) library(ggmap) library(ggrepel)  I took data of 5 runners from the website with the results and times each kilometer.</description>

And ofcourse to animate the visuals!
Data of water levels in the Netherlands are available through: https://waterinfo.rws.nl/#!/nav/index/ (in dutch)
