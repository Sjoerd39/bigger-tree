      <description>Post number 2? Yes! In an earlier post I made an animation of a running race. Since then I wanted to make a shiny app out of this idea so that people can add themselves on the track and animate their own race. And now it&amp;rsquo;s finally finished! You can try it for yourself here: seven hills race app.
I&amp;rsquo;ll explain some of the more important components of the app. The first thing is processing the user input.</description>

      <description>The 7-hills running race (7-heuvelenloop) is a yearly running race in and around Nijmegen. The main event is a race of 15 kilometers long. I ran it myself a couple of times, but not in last year. On to animating the race. Using the following packages:
library(tidyverse) library(zoo) library(readxl) library(lubridate) library(magrittr) library(gganimate) library(ggmap) library(ggrepel)  I took data of 5 runners from the website with the results and times each kilometer.</description>
