      <description>Post number 2? Yes! In an earlier post I made an animation of a running race. Since then I wanted to make a shiny app out of this idea so that people can add themselves on the track and animate their own race. And now it&amp;rsquo;s finally finished! You can try it for yourself here: seven hills race app.
I&amp;rsquo;ll explain some of the more important components of the app. The first thing is processing the user input.</description>

      <description>I was asked to introduce an Artificial Intelligence workshop for government employees (colleagues). I thought i could do that through an (AI) speech generator. So I made one. Incorporating some Language Processing techniques I recently worked with.
The generator contains the content of 45 speeches in Enlish, mainly of English and American statesman. The sentences are cleaned (minimally) and separated. Checked for their sentiment (positive or negative). In the app you can choose the overall sentiment of the speech and add your own welcoming and closing messages.</description>
