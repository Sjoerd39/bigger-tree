      <description>The 7-hills running race (7-heuvelenloop) is a yearly running race in and around Nijmegen. The main event is a race of 15 kilometers long. I ran it myself a couple of times, but not in last year. On to animating the race. Using the following packages:
library(tidyverse) library(zoo) library(readxl) library(lubridate) library(magrittr) library(gganimate) library(ggmap) library(ggrepel)  I took data of 5 runners from the website with the results and times each kilometer.</description>

      <description>One of the most entertaining things you could do at primary school was spelling words with the seven-segment calculator. A little while ago Tom Scott did a video about seven-segment displays. You can see it here:

 This is exactly the quick and fun exercise i need to start my blog. And i think R (plus some packages) is especially suited for this task. So, what are the longest words we can make with the limitations of a seven-segment display?</description>
