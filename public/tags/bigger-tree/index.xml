      <description>Happy holidays to you all! For a short project I turned the population pyramid of the city Nijmegen, the Netherlands into a shiny christmas tree.
The rough translation of the text is &amp;lsquo;have a good/ nice holiday and a significant happy new year&amp;rsquo;. The code for this tree you can see below. It has several sections, but the tree and the baubles are made in seperate dataframes but with the same time reference.</description>
