Hello! My name is Sjoerd Dikkerboom. Currently I work at the municipality of Nijmegen (the Netherlands) as a Researcher. I have a masters degree both in Sociology and Urban Geography. In my work I specialize in quantitative research and data science. In my free time i'm learning chinese with some succes: 你好，我的中文名字是大树 =). And sometimes i like to tinker with R and write about it here.
